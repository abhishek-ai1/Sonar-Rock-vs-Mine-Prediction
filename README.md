# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict whether an object in SONAR data is a rock or a mine using logistic regression. The dataset contains features that describe the acoustic properties of the objects, and the goal is to create a binary classification model for rock and mine detection.

This repository contains a Python implementation of a rock vs. mine prediction using the SONAR dataset. The prediction is performed using logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a rock vs. mine prediction model using the SONAR dataset. The dataset consists of sonar signals bounced off different surfaces, and the objective is to classify whether the object is a rock or a mine based on these signals. Logistic regression is employed as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Dataset
The [SONAR dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)) is used for this project. It contains 208 sonar signals, each with 60 attributes, representing the strength of the sonar returns at different angles. The dataset is divided into two classes: 'R' for rocks and 'M' for mines.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/abhishek-ai1/Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your SONAR dataset file (e.g., `sonar.csv`) in the project directory.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the logistic regression model by executing:
   ```shell
   python predict_rock_vs_mine.py
   ```

4. The program will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the logistic regression model, and display the accuracy of the model on the test set.

## Results
After running the `predict_rock_vs_mine.py` script, you will see the accuracy of the logistic regression model on the test data. This accuracy metric gives an indication of how well the model can predict whether a given signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.

Feel free to experiment with the dataset, algorithm parameters, and feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use logistic regression for predicting whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine. It showcases data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization. Feel free to modify and extend the project to experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, or additional features.
