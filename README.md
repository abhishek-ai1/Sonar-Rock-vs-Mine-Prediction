# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict whether an object in SONAR data is a rock or a mine using logistic regression. The dataset contains features that describe the acoustic properties of the objects, and the goal is to create a binary classification model for rock and mine detection.
